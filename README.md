A data visualization, sometimes referred to as a **“data viz,”** allows analysts to properly interpret data. A good way to think of data visualization is that it can be the difference between utter confusion and really grasping an issue. Creating effective data visualizations is a complex task. 

### Frameworks for organizing your thoughts about visualization
Frameworks can help you organize your thoughts about data visualization and give you a useful checklist to reference. Here are two frameworks that may be useful for you as you create your own data viz: 

**1) The McCandless Method**
You learned about the David McCandless method in the first lesson on effective data visualizations, but as a refresher, the McCandless Method lists four elements of good data visualization: 
- **Information:** the data you are working with
- **Story:** a clear and compelling narrative or concept
- **Goal:** a specific objective or function for the visual
- **Visual form:** an effective use of metaphor or visual expression

**2) Kaiser Fung’s Junk Charts Trifecta Checkup**
This approach is a useful set of questions that can help consumers of data visualization critique what they are consuming and determine how effective it is. The Checkup has three questions:
- What is the practical question? 
- What does the data say?
- What does the visual say?
