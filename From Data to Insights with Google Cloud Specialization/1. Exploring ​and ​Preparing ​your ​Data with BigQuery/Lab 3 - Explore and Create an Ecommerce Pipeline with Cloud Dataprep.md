## Explore and Create an Ecommerce Pipeline with Cloud Dataprep
In this lab, we will learn how to perform these tasks:

- Connect BigQuery datasets to Cloud Dataprep.
- Explore dataset quality with Cloud Dataprep.
- Create a data transformation pipeline with Cloud Dataprep.
- Run transformation jobs outputs to BigQuery.

## Creating a BigQuery Dataset

####  Create an empty BigQuery dataset and copies over a subset of the public raw ecommerce dataset to your own project dataset for you to explore and clean in Cloud Dataprep.
```
#standardSQL
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE
  ecommerce.all_sessions_raw_dataprep OPTIONS( description="Raw data from analyst team to ingest into Cloud Dataprep" ) AS
SELECT
  *
FROM
  `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions_raw`
WHERE
  date = '20170801'; # limiting to one day of data 56k rows for this lab
``` 
## Connect BigQuery data to Cloud Dataprep

- Create Flow -  Flow Name, type Ecommerce Analytics Pipeline - Flow Description, type 
- Revenue reporting table for Apparel - Create - Add Datasets - Add Datasets to Flow - 
- Import Datasets - BigQuery - ecommerce - ecommerce.all_sessions_raw_dataprep - 
- Create dataset - Import & Add to Flow - Add new Recipe

## Explore ecommerce data fields with a UI
- Load and explore a sample of the dataset within Cloud Dataprep

#### How many columns are in the dataset?
- Answer: 32 columns

####  When your pipeline is run, it will operate over the entire source dataset. How many rows does the sample contain?
- Answer: About 12 thousands rows

#### What is the most common value in the channelGrouping column?
- Answer: Referral

#### What are the top three countries from which sessions are originated?
- Answer: US, India, United Kingdom

#### What does the grey bar under totalTransactionRevenue represent?
- Answer: Missing values

#### What is the average timeOnSite in seconds, average pageviews, and average sessionQualityDim for the data sample? (Hint: Use Column Details.)
Answers:
- **Average Time On Site:** 942 seconds (or 15.7 minutes)
-  **Average Pageviews:** 20.44 pages
- **Average Session Quality Dimension:** 38.36

#### Looking at the histogram for sessionQualityDim, are the data values evenly distributed?
- Answer: No, they are skewed to lower values (low quality sessions), which is expected.

#### What is the date range for the dataset sample?
- Answer: 8/1/2017 (one day of data)

#### Why is there a red bar under the productSKU column?
- Answer: A red bar indicates mismatched values. Cloud Dataprep automatically identified the productSKU column type as an integer. Cloud Dataprep also detected some non-integer values and therefore flagged those as mismatched. In fact, the productSKU is not always an integer (for example, a correct value might be "GGOEGOCD078399"). So in this case, Cloud Dataprep incorrectly identified the column type: it should be a string, not an integer.

#### Looking at v2ProductName, what are the most popular products?
- Answer: Nest products

#### Looking at v2ProductCategory, what are some of the most popular products? How many categories were sampled?
 Answer: 
- Nest
- Bags
- (not set) (which means that some sessions are not associated with a category)

#### True or False: The most common productVariant is COLOR.
- Answer: False. It's (not set) because most products do not have variants (80%+)

#### What are the two categories of type?
- Answer: PAGE and EVENT

#### What is the average productQuantity?
- Answer: 3.45 (your answer may vary)


#### What is the dominant currency code for transactions?
- Answer: USD

#### Are there valid values for itemQuantity or item Revenue?
- Answer: No, they are all NULL values.

#### What percentage of transaction IDs have a valid value? What does this represent for our ecommerce dataset?
- Answer: About 4.6% of transaction IDs have a valid value, which represents the average conversion rate of the website (4.6% of visitors transact).

#### How many eCommerceAction_type values are there, and what is the most common value?
-  There are seven values found in our sample. The most common value is zero 0 which indicates that the type is unknown. This makes sense as the majority of the web sessions on our website will not perform any ecommerce actions as they are just browsing.


## Clean the data
- Delete unused columns
- Deduplicate rows
- Filter out sessions without revenue
- Filter out sessions for just Type = â€˜PAGE'
-  Filter for apparel products
- Enrich the data
- Create a new column for a unique session ID
-  Create a case statement for the ecommerce action type
-  Run and schedule Cloud Dataprep jobs to BigQuery
