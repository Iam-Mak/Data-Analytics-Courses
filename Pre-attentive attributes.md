## Pre-attentive attributes: marks and channels

**Pre-attentive** attributes are the elements of a data visualization that people recognize automatically without conscious effort. The essential, basic building blocks that make visuals immediately understandable are called marks and channels. 
### Marks
**M​arks** are basic visual objects like points, lines, and shapes. Every mark can be broken down into four qualities: 
- 1. **Position** - Where a specific mark is in space in relation to a scale or to other marks.

- 2. **Size** - How big, small, long, or tall a mark is.

- 3. **Shape** - Whether a specific object is given a shape that communicates something about it.

- 4.**Color** - What color the mark is.

### Channels
**C​hannels** are visual aspects or variables that represent characteristics of the data. Channels are basically marks that have been used to visualize data. Channels will vary in terms of how effective they are at communicating data based on three elements: 

**1. Accuracy** - Are the channels helpful in accurately estimating the values being represented? 
For example, color is very accurate when communicating categorical differences, like apples and oranges. But it is much less effective when distinguishing quantitative data like 5 from 5.5.

**2. Popout** - How easy is it to distinguish certain values from others? 
There are many ways of drawing attention to specific parts of a visual, and many of them leverage pre-attentive attributes like line length, size, line width, shape, enclosure, hue, and intensity.

**3. Grouping** - How good is a channel at communicating groups that exist in the data? 
Consider the proximity, similarity, enclosure, connectedness, and continuity of the channel.

But, remember: the more you emphasize different things, the less that emphasis counts. The more you emphasize one single thing, the more that counts. 

## Design principles
Design principles are important to your work as a data analyst because they help you make sure that you are creating visualizations that communicate your data effectively to your audience. By keeping these rules in mind, you can plan and evaluate your data visualizations to decide if they are working for you and your goals. And, if they aren’t, you can adjust them! 

**1. Choose the right visual**
One of the first things you have to decide is which visual will be the most effective for your audience. Sometimes, a simple table is the best visualization. Other times, you need a more complex visualization to illustrate your point. 

**2. Optimize the data-ink ratio**
The data-ink entails focusing on the part of the visual that is essential to understanding the point of the chart. Try to minimize non-data ink like boxes around legends or shadows to optimize the data-ink ratio.

**3. Use orientation effectively**
Make sure the written components of the visual, like the labels on a bar chart, are easy to read. You can change the orientation of your visual to make it easier to read and understand. 

**4. Color**
There are a lot of important considerations when thinking about using color in your visuals. These include using color consciously and meaningfully, staying consistent throughout your visuals, being considerate of what colors mean to different people, and using inclusive color scales that make sense for everyone viewing them.

**5. Numbers of things**
Think about how many elements you include in any visual. If your visualization uses lines, try to plot five or fewer. If that isn’t possible, use color or hue to emphasize important lines. Also, when using visuals like pie charts, try to keep the number of segments to less than seven since too many elements can be distracting.
