## SQL for Data Analysis 

### Setting up the environment:
[Check here to create database and table in BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/tables)

**Database used:**
Parch and Posey, a hypothetical paper company's sales data of different types of paper (regular, gloss, standard). The database consists of different tables linked with a database schema. 

### Entity Relationship Diagrams
An entity relationship diagram (ERD) is a common way to view data in a database. Below is the ERD for the database we will use from Parch & Posey. These diagrams help you visualize the data you are analyzing including:

- The names of the tables.
- The columns in each table.
- The way the tables work together.

The "crow's foot" that connects the tables together shows us how the columns in one table relate to the columns in another table.

### What to Notice
In the Parch & Posey database there are five tables (essentially 5 spreadsheets):

- web_events
- accounts
- orders
- sales_reps
- region
